### Idea

A completely offline input method: when people type in some English sentence using the standard English soft keyboard, the corresponding Chinese meaning of that sentence will appear in the text field.

Details please see cover letter.

### Note to reviewer

Links in pdf doesn't seem to work but those in the docx should work. Please let me know if not for you.
